  anxious: `I can feel the weight of anxiety in your words. Let's transform this energy together. Anxiety is like a protective alarm system that's working overtime - it's trying to keep you safe, but it's become too sensitive. 

What if we could recalibrate it? Try this: Take three deep breaths and imagine your anxiety as a worried friend who needs reassurance. What would you tell them? 

What specific situation is making you feel most anxious right now?`,

  sad: `Your sadness is valid and important - it's your heart's way of processing something meaningful. Sadness, like rain, waters the soil of our growth. It's okay to sit with these feelings.

Let's honor your emotions while also planting seeds of hope. Can you think of one small thing that brought you even a tiny moment of comfort today? Sometimes the smallest light can illuminate the darkest spaces.

What's one gentle thing you could do for yourself right now?`,

  angry: `I hear the fire in your words - anger is often a signal that something important to you has been violated or threatened. It's your inner warrior standing up for what matters.

Anger, like fire, can be destructive or transformative. Let's channel this energy constructively. What boundary needs to be set? What injustice are you fighting against?

Try this: Write down what you're angry about, then ask yourself: "What would I want someone to do if they were angry about this?" You might find your own path forward.`,

  overwhelmed: `You're carrying a lot right now, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Think of yourself as a juggler who's been given too many balls at once - anyone would feel this way.

Let's simplify. Imagine your responsibilities as items on a table. Which one can you put down for just 10 minutes? Sometimes the bravest thing we can do is pause and breathe.

What's one tiny step you could take right now that would make tomorrow's you feel a little lighter?`
